## Installation
1. You will first need to download the <b>eggcraft.zip</b> file in releases. After this, you will need to extract the zip file so
that all you have is the folder <b>eggcraft</b> with the contents of <b>data</b>, <b>pack.mcmeta</b>, and <b>pack.png</b> inside.
Again, it should not be a zip file, it should be a normal folder.
<br />
<br />

3. On World Creation, you will now have 3 tabs along the top of your screen: Game, World, More.
